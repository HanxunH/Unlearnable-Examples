I am a PhD student in the School of Computing and Information Systems, [The University of Melbourne](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/). I am supervised by Prof. [James Bailey](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/baileyj/), Dr. [Xingjun Ma](http://xingjunma.com/) and Dr. [Sarah Erfani](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/smonazam/). Prior to my PhD, I completed my Master’s at University of Melbourne and Bachelor’s study at [Purdue University](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/). I also spent a few years in the industry. While my research focus is adversarial machine learning, neural architecture search and robust machine learning.
